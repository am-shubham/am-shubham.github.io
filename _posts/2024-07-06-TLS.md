## Introduction

- Server authentication is an important part of TLS handshake because we need to verify the authenticity of the server to which we are sending our confidential data
- Usually the server doesn't need to authenticate the client but it can be done, for more details refer:
- The main requirement of this step is for confidently obtaining the public key of the server
    - i.e. How do we make sure xyz is the public key of abc.com
    - This is important because we will be using this public key for exchanging the symmetric key's between server-client

## Digital Certificate

- Naturally this mean's we need some trusted third party to help in this exchange 
    - This trusted third party is called a **certificate-authority (CA)**
    - The CA issues **digital certificates** certifying that xyz is *indeed* the public key of abc.com
- As a part of the TLS handshake the server sends it's digital certificate, this certificate contains 
    - The public key of the server
    - URL of the server 
    - Validity and other basic details
    - Signature for verifying the above information
    - Public key of CA 
    - The process of signing is very simple the CA hashes all the data and then encrypt's it using its private key
        - So when you see the signature algorithm as something like: PKCS #1 SHA-256 With RSA Encryption, then think of it in 2 parts, SHA-256 as the hashing algorithm and RSA as the encryption algorithm
        - signature = Encrypt(Hash(claims-of-certificate), private-key-CA)

## How do we verify the digital signature ?

- To verify the digital signature we use the CA's public key embedded in the certificate
    - Hash(claims-of-certificate) = decrypt(siganture, public-key-CA)
- But we are back to the same problem again
    - How do we verify the CA ? 
    - How do we make sure this certificate was not issued by a malicious party ? 
    - How do we make sure that the public key present in certificate is indeed of the CA that we trust ?
    - Again the problem we face is *how to verify cde is the public key of ca1.com*
    - This means we need the CA to present a certificate as well, a certificate which was signed by another *Trused party*
    - Who is this truested party ? well it is again a CA !!
    - We continue this process of verifying certificate's till we reach a special-certificate which was signed by **root CA**

## Root CA
- Why is this root CA special ? 
- It's special because we don't have any mean's of verifying the root CA's public key
    - Think about it, it's a chain of certificates and we are bound to reach the root, the root which started everything
- Because we don't have any mean's of verifying the root CA, so the public key of root CA is hardcoded on the device itself !!
    - i.e it comes pre-installed along with the device
    - There are only 100-200 root CA's 
    - because the root CA's public key is embedded in hardware and trusted by all the device's in the world so there private key's cannot be leaked under any circumstances
    - For this reason they aren't even on the internet
    - They were used just for signing the intermediate CA's and now the intermediate CA's carry over all the work
    - The work of verifying server's, their owner/organisation and everything else is done by intermediate CA's
- All of this work of traversing the chain is done by the browser's chaining algorithms
- So in the end once we reach the root certificate we use the public key embedded in our device and do a simple string match to compare them
- After all of this is done, we have safely obtained of the public key of the server we intend to talk to
- This is a simple explaination of what happens, obviously it is optimised by the browsers at various steps
